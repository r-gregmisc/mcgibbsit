Description: 
  Implementation of Warnes & Raftery's MCGibbsit run-length diagnostic
  for a set of (not-necessarily independent) Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  (MCMC) samplers.  It combines the estimate error-bounding approach
  of the Raftery and Lewis MCMC run length diagnostic `gibbsit` with
  the between verses within chain approach of the Gelman and Rubin
  MCMC convergence diagnostic.
