Description: 
  'mcgibbsit' provides an implementation of Warnes & Raftery's
  MCGibbsit run-length diagnostic for a set of (not-necessarily
  independent) MCMC samplers.  It combines the estimate error-bounding
  approach of the Raftery and Lewis MCMC run length diagnostic with
  the between verses within chain approach of the Gelman and
  Rubin MCMC convergence diagnostic.
